            "Molly McCord discusses the intense astrological energies from February 7th to 14th, which may cause disruptions and agitation but also offer opportunities for personal growth and evolution. The alignment of personal planets with Pluto and the upcoming Aquarius New Moon bring a desire for change and expansion. It is important to ground oneself and manage impulsive thoughts and emotions during this time. The speaker also mentions the significance of Valentine's Day falling during Aquarius season and the upcoming conjunction of Chiron and the True North Node. They also announce upcoming events and encourage listeners to check out their website and YouTube channel for more information.\n"
